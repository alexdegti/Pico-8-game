# Synthdonatsu
A little shmup I've put together in my spare time. Nothing fancy, I just wanted to actually code
a game from scratch and **enjoy doing it. :)**

The evil and wicked synthdonatsu are plotting to invade planet earth and rob it of all the doughnuts.
You must venture into space and put a spanner in the works in order to prevent this dreadful fate.
Go and save the doughnuts!
